 * Author : Maulik Gohil & Neel Kalariya
 * Change log: 
 *	Date Feb 26, 2020 > Created this file with whatever you have explained/write down in the class.
 *	Date Feb 27, 2020 > Wrote if code and its while loop as Pseudo code because We couldn't implement Queue that day.
 *	Date Feb 28, 2020 > Added line -> dqid = dequeue(&xque[currxid]) as we were done with Queue Implementation.
 *			  > Added ualarm for the critical section 
 *			  > Added the same two lines "xtab[currxid].xstate = XZOMBIE;" & "xtab[currxid].status = status;" 
 *		            which are in else block in the end of the if block,	because after dequeue, exiting thread should  
 *     			    become ZOMBIE and its own status should be saved in its status variable.
