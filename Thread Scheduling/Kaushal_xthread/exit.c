/*---------------------------------------------------
 *  xthread_exit  -  thread exits and becomes Zombie

 * Name: Shivam Joshi, Kaushal Prajapati
 * Change log: 
 *		Date Feb 26, 2020 > Created this file with whatever you have explained/write down in the class.
 *		Date Feb 27, 2020 > Wrote if code and its while loop as Pseudo code because We couldn't implement Queue that day.
 *		Date Feb 28, 2020 > Added line -> dqid = dequeue(&xque[currxid]) as we were done with Queue Implementation.
 *						  > Added ualarm for the critical section 
 *						  > Added the same two lines "xtab[currxid].xstate = XZOMBIE;" & "xtab[currxid].status = status;" 
 *							which are in else block in the end of the if block,	because after dequeue, exiting thread should  *							 become ZOMBIE and its own status should be saved in its status variable.
