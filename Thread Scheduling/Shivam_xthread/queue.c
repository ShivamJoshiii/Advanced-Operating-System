/*
Name: Shivam Joshi, Kaushal Prajapati
Code Description: A Queue has be defined in proc.h with tabs as elements is an array to store the items, size to get how many elements are present, capacity is the final length of queue, front to get the first value from the queue, rear to get the last value of the queue. createQueue() will be called once for each queue where we will initialized and allocate location for the elements to store and initialized all the other variables. Dequeue() will check the queue is empty or not, if not then it will return the first popped element. Enqueue() will check the queue is full or not, if not then it will insert an element into the queue.
Change Log:	2/24/2020: Implemented the createQueue function
		2/25/2020: Implemented the Enenque and Dequeue function
		2/26/2020: Debugging enqueue and dequeue
